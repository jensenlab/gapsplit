# gapsplit

Efficient sampling for COBRA models. `gapsplit` samples both convex (LP) and non-convex (MILP) models by targeting unexplored regions of the solution space.

`gapsplit` is available for both Matlab and Python.

## Matlab Installation

Download the `gapsplit` repository and add the `matlab` directory to Matlab's path.
